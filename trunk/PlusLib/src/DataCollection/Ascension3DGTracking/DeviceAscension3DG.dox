\section Ascension3DGSupportedPlatforms Supported platforms

- Windows 7 (32-bit), Vista (32-bit), Windows XP embedded (32-bit).

\section Ascension3DGInstallation Installation

- Sensors must be all located in front of the frontplate of the field generator (the side with large the Ascension motif on it): tools are still tracked behind the frontplate, but their orientation may be inverted.
- If pose measurement seems to be incorrect (somewhat translated/rotated) then unplug the sensor and plug it in again.
- Tracking a Stylus: It is recommended to place the EM sensor as close to the needle tip as possible. The best accuracy is expected from a thick needle with a sensor near the needle tip. 
- If you are using the tracker of an Ultrasonix SonixGPS system and the Exam software is running (e.g., because images are acquired using the Ulterius interface), then you need to disable the SonixGPS license to prevent the Exam software from using the tracker. This is done because only one application can communicate with the tracker at a time (either your application or the Exam software). To disable SonixGPS press menu on the touchscreen. Go to Administrator, Licenses and unselect SonixGPS from the licenses menu.

\section QualityValues Quality values

The tool ports \c quality1 and \c quality2  provide the quality values for all the tools.

The quality numbers are stored in the translation component of the transformation matrix. If a value is not available then it is set to -1.
- \c quality1: quality values for sensor port 0-2.
- \c quality2: quality values for sensor port 3-5 (usually there are only 4 ports, so quality values for port 4 and 5 are not available).
