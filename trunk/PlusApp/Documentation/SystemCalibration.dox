\section SystemCalibrationConfiguration Configuration
1. Select the Device set from the Ultrasound display and then select fcal from the options that appear.
2. Open a command session from within the directory where fCal.exe is kept and enter "fCal.exe" in the command line
(you can also just double-click on fCal.exe).
3. Select the configuration file corresponding to your hardware setup
4. Optionally edit the configuration file (to change IP address, port numbers, etc.)
5. Click Connect
6. Wait for all of the devices to connect
7. Check that the instruments (Probe and Stylus) can be seen by the camera. This can be done by looking within the
interface for a small box on the left that will either say "missing" or "OK".
The tool state box can be detached so that it is visible during all steps by clicking on the little button in its corner.

\section SystemCalibrationStylusCalibration Stylus Calibration
1. Place the Stylus in a position that allows the tip of the needle to remain stationary and for all of the sensors to
be seen by the camera.
2. Click start and begin to swivel the needle until all the points have been collected. The tip of the stylus must remain
stationary relative to the Reference marker on the phantom, therefore it is advisable to place the stylus tip on the phantom surface (or make sure that the phantom does not move during the stylus calibration).
3. There is no need to save once this is done.

\section SystemCalibrationPhantomRegistration Phantom Registration
1. If you haven't disconnected since Stylus calibration, then there is no need to import a calibration result, also if the
loaded device set configuration contained one.
2. A small window on the left will indicate the points that are to be selected on the phantom.
The content of this window can be rotated and zoomed using the mouse.
3. Place the tip of the calibrated Stylus at the indicated point of the phantom and select "Record Point" while the Stylus is in view of the camera.
4. If you have selected a wrong point there is an option to "Undo" the last recorded point or a "Reset" button to start from the beginning.

\section SystemCalibrationTemporalCalibration Temporal Calibration

Typically imaging data and position tracking data is acquired by different hardware devices, therefore the time delay
between data acquisition and reception in the Plus data collector may be different. This time difference can be up to
300-400ms (depending on the hardware devices, data acquisition settings, computer hardware, connection type, network or CPU load, ...).
This difference in time delay has to be taken into account when acquiring tracked ultrasound data (pairing of image and tracking data).

The hardware devices typically do not provide an accurate timestamp for the acquisition of each frame, and even if they do,
the time reference (clock) of the various hardware devices are typically not synchronized. Therefore, Plus records the timestamp
when it receives the data, applies timestamp filtering to reduce the effect of varying transmission delay, and applies
a device-specific time offset value.

Temporal calibration in fCal measures the device-specific time offset difference automatically. Below is a video tutorial
on demonstrating how to use the temporal calibration algorithm in fCal.

\section SystemCalibrationSpatialCalibration Spatial Calibration

For optimal results always perform temporal calibration before spatial calibration.

For calibration of curvilinear transducers the sound of speed setting in the ultrasound imager shall match
the actual speed of sound in the liquid where the calibration is performed in (otherwise the image will be
distorted after scan conversion). Either set the speed of sound to in the ultrasound machine (to about 1490m/s 
orresponding to speed of sound in room temperature water), or use a mixture in that the speed of sound matches
the typical speed of 1540m/s in soft tissue (e.g., 9% by volume mixture of ethylene glycol and water, degassed -
see Goldstein et al. "Design of Quality Assurance for Sonographic Prostate Brachytherapy Needle Guides", 2002).

1. Click Start
2. Move the probe slowly so that all the phantom wires are visible. Use the most degrees of freedom possible.
3. Green dots should appear over the wire points in the image as you move the probe. It indicates the
successfully segmented points.
If they don't appear, cancel the calibration by clicking on Cancel button, and bring up the Segmentation
parameter dialog by pressing the edit icon next to the Segmentation parameters import button
  1. Press Freeze button if the image shows all the wires (it seems suitable for segmentation)
  2. Check if initial spacing is correct. For giving a hint on image spacing to fCal, select the checkbox
  next to spacing. It will give you two rulers, a green (G) and a blue (B). You can manually enter two
  known distances that appear on the image, one horizontal and one vertical. Then set the visual rulers
  on the image to represent these distances. You can do this by dragging the end points of the ruler.
  3. It's usually a good idea to unfreeze the image at this point and play with the "Gain" setting on your
  ultrasound machine to find the optimal value when dots (wires) on the image are all visible but not too large.
  4. If wires are still not recognized, you can freeze the image again, and change the other segmentation
  parameters. The first goal is to find all the candidates (red dots). If the wires are detected as
  candidates (they are red), the next step is the pattern recognition (make them green). When green
  dots appear on the wires in the parameter editor, then unfreeze, return to the Freehand Calibration tab
  and see if the segmentation is good enough on the other images.
4. Once the calibration has been done, the result transformation matrix and the errors appear in the toolbox, and the Show devices checkbox becomes enabled
5. Check Show devices to see the devices in 3D
6. You can save the results by clicking the Save results button

\section SystemCalibrationFaq Frequently asked questions

\subsection q1 What are the differences between the different calibration phantom versions?

You can find the CAD models and screenshots of the calibration phantoms in the following directories:
- https://www.assembla.com/code/plus/subversion/nodes/trunk/PlusLib/data/CADModels/fCalPhantom
- https://www.assembla.com/code/plus/subversion/nodes/trunk/PlusLib/docs/fCAL/CAD

\subsection q2 The phantom size and hole positions are the same for fCal_1.x and fCal_2.x (only some text labels and marker mounting holes are added).

You can use different wiring patterns in the phantom. Currently we use two configurations (see https://www.assembla.com/code/plus/subversion/nodes/trunk/PlusLib/docs/fCAL/CAD)
- wiring_1.0: uses 2 N-wire patterns, used by the the original method developed by Chen et al.
- wiring_1.1: uses 3 N-wires, we have found this to be more robust and accurate than using just 2 N-wires

\subsection q3 I get large (>1mm) stylus calibration error - what's wrong?

Typical stylus calibration error is about 0.5-1.0mm. If you have higher error then check the followings:

- The pose marker should not be farther than a couple of centimeters from the tip of the stylus
- The stylus shall be rotated in as large angle range as possible
- If an electromagnetic tracker is used then the pose marker on the stylus and the reference pose marker shall be well within the working range of the field generator and there should be no metallic object nearby that could cause field distortion
- The tip of the stylus shall be sharp and should not move at all during pivoting

\subsection q3 I get large (>2-3mm) spatial calibration error - what's wrong?

Typical calibration error is 1-2mm, which can go down to <0.5mm with an optimal setup.

If you have larger error check the followings:
- Image orientation: Verify the image orientation: the M and F arrows in the segmentation parameter dialog box should point to the marked and far side of the image. If not correct then you have to set the correct image orientation in the configuration file (by modifying the PortUsImageOrientation="MF" to MN, UF, or UN). 
- Wiring: loose wires, wires not in the correct holes. For fCal 1.x phantoms: wire not aligned to the correct side of the hole.
- Optimize image acquisition to avoid incorrect fiducial segmentations: Fiducial line intersection points should appear as small circular-shaped blobs and the rest of the image should be almost black. Decrease the dynamic range to improve contrast. Decrease gain and increase threshold to make the background as dark as possible and to make the fiducial line intersections as small as possible, while being still detectable by the segmentation algorithm. Reduce reflections by slightly changing the transducer angle or putting sound absorbing material in the water container (such as rubber or sponge). Keep the transducer's axial (direction of sound travel) axis orthogonal to the wires for optimal reflection from the wires. If the intersection blobs are not circular then set the focal point distance(s) of the transducer to match the depth of the fiducial wires. If two or more candidate fiducials (red points) appear at a wire position in the image then try to increase the MorphologicalOpeningBarSizeMm value (to something between 2.0mm - 10.0mm).
- Temporal calibration: perform temporal calibration. If you suspect that your temporal calibration is inaccurate (you don't have accurate time offset value between the image and tracking information) then move the transducer slowly to reduce the effect of potential temporal misalignment (you may reduce the frame rate to prevent collecting too many similar frames)
- Tracking accuracy: Electromagnetic tracking accuracy decreases as you take the sensor farther from the transmitter and may be also impacted by nearby metallic objects.  So, make sure your sensors are all close to the transmitter during calibration. With the Ascension3DG tracker the ideal distance is at 10-15 cm (has an error about 1 mm), while at 25-30 cm the error is about 2-3 mm (depending on the sensor size).
- Probe orientation: make sure that the probe orientation is correct (for fCal_2.x_Wiring_1.x the marked side of the probe shall be close to the A1 point). The wire numbers are shown in fCal during spatial calibration and in the segmentation parameter setting dialog box, which can help in verification of the correct orientation. To verify the probe orientation: touch a w1 wire with your finger => your finger should appear near w1 wire on the US image. If your finger appears at a different wire (and you are sure that the image orientation is set correctly) then you don’t keep the marked side of the probe on the w1 wire’s side – in this case simply rotate the probe by 180 deg (and keep it in this orientation while collecting the calibration data). #435 will enable automatic detection of the probe orientation.
- Try moving the sensor closer to the transducer tip. This reduces the lever arm effect and may reduce the calibration error.
- Make sure that the wires in the phantom cover the area where you want to achieve good accuracy (e.g., if you need good accuracy at 3-5cm distance from the transducer then have your calibration wires at 2, 4, and 6 cm from the transducer).
- Use more N wires (e.g., 3 N wires, see wiring-1.1, as opposed to just 2 N wires, see wiring-1.0 of the fCal phantom) and increase the distance between them to reduce the out-of-plane rotation error. The fCal 2.x phantom is designed for linear transducers and shallow imaging depth (up to 5-10cm), while fCal 3.x phantom is designed for deeper imaging (10-20cm) with curvilinear probes.
- Calibrations can be improved by a simple, but tedious manual method in 3D Slicer. If you have experience with fiducial registration and the usage of the LiveUltrasound module, you can record needle tip positions using the needle sensor (in one fiducial list) and the image of the needle tip (in another fiducial list). The registration between these fiducial list may result in a matrix that can improve your calibration if concatenated with the one produced by fCal.

\subsection q5 The axes of the ImageToProbeTransform (calibration matrix) are not orthogonal

The probe calibration algorithm determines the ImageToProbeTransform axes independently, therefore if there is an error in the calibration procedure then the computed coordinate axes may not be orthogonal.

\subsection q6 How to detect: when the computed axes are not orthogonal fCal displays a warning message and the "User image to probe transform matrix orthogonality test failed" warning message is logged.

Root cause: most frequently the root cause of the problem is that the phantom description does not match the actual phantom geometry (the wire positions in the phantom are not the same as the actual wire positions) or it may be caused by having a large number of fiducial line intersection point detection errors (the calibration algorithm can remove a limited number of outliers if they are very different from the true positions and the outliers are less than about 5-10% of the data).

Resolution:
1. Check that the phantom description matches the actual phantom wiring
2. Check that the fiducial line intersection points are correctly detected on the images. Adjust the segmentation parameters, if necessary.
3. Use a phantom with more N-wire patterns (the problem is more likely to happen with 2 N-wires than with 3 N-wires)
4. Performs all the checks listed in the "I get large (>2-3mm) calibration error..." section

Plus can enforce the ImageToProbe matrix to be orthogonal. To enable this feature, add two attributes to the vtkProbeCalibrationAlgo element: OptimizationMethod="2D" and IsotropicPixelSpacing="TRUE". Set IsotropicPixelSpacing to false if you use a linear probe and you calibrate in a liquid in that the speed of sound is not the same as the setting in the ultrasound scanner (e.g., speed of sound in water is about 1490m/s, speed of sound by default on most ultrasound scanners is set to 1540m/s).

\subsection q7 No points can be collected during stylus calibration

If the stylus has been calibrated already (e.g., with the NDI toolviewer) then the stylus position remains the same when the stylus is pivoted around its tip. The stylus calibration method requires unique positions, therefore the algorithm will not work if it is attempted to apply on an already calibrated stylus.

If the stylus has been already calibrated outside PLUS then just add the following calibration matrix to the CoordinateDefinitions element in the device set configuration file:

    <Transform From="StylusTip" To="Stylus" Matrix="1 0 0 0   0 1 0 0   0 0 1 0   0 0 0 1" /> 

then in fCal simply skip the stylus calibration step.

\subsection q8 There is a misalignment along the M-U (marked-unmarked) axis after spatial calibration

This is probably caused by inaccurate stylus or phantom calibration. If you use an electromagnetic tracker then place the sensor as close to the needle tip as possible. If possible, use a thick needle (with a sensor near the tip of the needle) as stylus.
